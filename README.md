Dbms project using sql and plsql 

This is an online food delivery system

This management system stores data from restaurants and cafes such as details about payments, delivery, menu, offers, reviews, customers, categories, bookings and feedback. Users can fetch details according to requirements from this database.

Our online Food delivery system helps people in ordering various foods and beverages from some local restaurant through the use of the internet, just by sitting at home or any place and the order is delivered directly to their desired location.
Admin can add and remove restaurants and customers. It allows them to manage customer profiles.
For restaurants we record: Restaurant ID, Restaurant Name, Restaurant Address, Restaurant ratings, menu items etc.
For customers we record: Customers ID, Customers Name, Customers Address, Customers Reviews, Cart items etc. The main goal is to maintain restaurant functions in an effective and accurate manner.

This project helps maintain day-to-day records of food orders in the system. It is basically keeping a proper record of the database.
